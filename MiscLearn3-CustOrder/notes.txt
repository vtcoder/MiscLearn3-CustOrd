Things to learn/do:
- DONE: Add font awesome via bower
- Add SASS (via bower?)

Proj level:
- Do a partion table version instead of name/value tables
- Other customization variations?
- Target .net core only and deploy to linux VM
- Look at overridable logic via roslyn
- Look at overridable views (asp.net?, angular2?, combo of both?)
- Look at using Jenkins for build
