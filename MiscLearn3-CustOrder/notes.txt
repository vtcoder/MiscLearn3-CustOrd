Things to learn/do:
- Add SASS (via bower?)
- Add font awesome via bower

Proj level:
- Do a partion table version instead of name/value tables
- Other customization variations?
- Target .net core only and deploy to linux VM
- Look at overridable logic via roslyn
- Look at overridable views (asp.net?, angular2?, combo of both?)
- Look at using Jenkins for build
